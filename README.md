# Laptop_Price_Predictor
The "Laptop Price Prediction" project is a machine learning model designed to predict the prices of laptops based on their features. This project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of laptops, such as processor type, RAM, storage capacity, graphics card, brand, and more. By training a machine learning algorithm on this dataset, the model becomes capable of making accurate predictions about the price of a laptop given its specifications, and hence this project provides a solution to one of the most common challenges consumers face when purchasing laptops: estimating the appropriate price range for a laptop with specific specifications.

The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and potentially deployment to create a user-friendly interface for predicting laptop prices. It aims to provide users with a convenient tool to estimate laptop prices before making purchasing decisions.

It is an ongoing project and am working on further improvements.
